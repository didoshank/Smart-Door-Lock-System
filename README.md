# Smart-Door-Lock-System
The Smart door lock system has been previously implemented using several techniques. However, the purpose of this project is to introduce yet another, but simpler technique to achieve the same result. This technique focuses majorly on the use of the Arduino Uno, Servo motor, Blynk app and the Keypad as the focal points for this project.
