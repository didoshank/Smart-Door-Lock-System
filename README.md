# Smart-Door-Lock-System

The Smart door lock system has been previously implemented using several techniques. However, the purpose of this project is to introduce yet another, but simpler technique to achieve the same result. This technique focuses majorly on the use of the Arduino Uno, Servo motor, Blynk app and the Keypad as the focal points for this project.

The idea was to build a smart lock which works intelligently without having too many components. We intend it to have a Keypad and Blynk app which would work simultaneously in case one doesn’t work, upon conformation the Arduino runs the Servo motor which would then lift the hinge attached to the door. After a delay of few seconds it locks again. If wrong password is entered more than twice it would sound the buzzer. The use Blynk app will help us in controlling the Arduino wirelessly from anywhere.

The motivation behind this arises from the fact that we currently don’t have many options for smart locks which allows easy access to both users and guests. Our unique selling point is the affordability, easy to use and secure. The smart lock is designed mostly for residential housing and offices.
